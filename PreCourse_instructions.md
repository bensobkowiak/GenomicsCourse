[BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org) (This will install the three programs we will use in this course, BEAUti, BEAST and TreeAnnotator) <br>
[Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)<br>
[FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)<br>
Any Extended Text Viewer (e.g., [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) for mac, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) for all systems) <br>
[FASTQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)<br>
[Tablet](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/tablet/)<br>
[AliView](https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/)<br>
<br>

#### Command line software

We will be running some programs with the Linux command line interface. 

If you are using Mac OS or Ubuntu, you can run these programs through the Terminal. If you are using Windows, please follow this guide to install a linux terminal on a Windows machine:

[Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) <br>

Also, some of these software can be easily installed using package management tools such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh) for mac or [apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management) for Linux/Windows (Windows 10+).

For example, with homebrew on mac, you can simply enter the following command into your terminal to install SAMtools on your system:

```bash
brew install samtools
```
Alternatively, here is a guide to install SAMtools/BCFtools on Ubuntu:

[Install SAMtools](https://gist.github.com/adefelicibus/f6fd06df1b4bb104ceeaccdd7325b856) <br>


Please download the following command line software:

[Trimmomatic](https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic/releases/tag/v0.39) <br>
[Burrow-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) <br>
[SAMtools/BCFtools](http://www.htslib.org) <br>
[GATK](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases) <br>
[mafft](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) <br>
[IQtree](http://www.iqtree.org) <br>
[TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime) <br>

#### R programs

These programs can be installed within R using
```R
install.packages()
```

[ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html) <br>
